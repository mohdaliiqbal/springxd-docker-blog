###Spring-XD Dockerized
We at EMC and the federation (VMWare/Pivotal) are using Spring XD heavily on some of our large scale big data projects. To make it more simpler get up an running with Spring XD I was tasked to write a docker compose based spring xd development setup so that developers can just do *"docker-compose up"* and they are good to go.

Following URL points to a github project which does exactly that.

1. Download [Docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox)
2. Open Kitematic from the toolbox installation.
